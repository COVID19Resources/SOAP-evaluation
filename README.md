# Starting with SOAP: rapid deployment of contact tracing technologies in a pandemic

This repository contains a white paper outlining an evaluation method for contact tracing technologies that reflects the needs and concerns of a range of actors associated with contact tracing.

Our aim is to create space for discussing and evaluating potential contact tracing technologies according to several criteria. These include: the extent to which technologies supporting contact tracing preserve individual or community privacy; the extent to which they’re secure from malicious or inadvertent misuse; how suitable they are for operational use as part of a health authority’s response to an outbreak; and the extent to which assurance of that technology - validating that it is working as intended - is possible.

SOAP has been designed with support from researchers across the ANU, including computer scientists, cryptographers, legal scholars, epidemiologists, philosophers, data analysts, user researchers, anthropologists, engineers and social scientists. The technical, social, legal and contextual considerations it includes reflect the practicalities - and complexities - of designing and deploying technology solutions. These decisions cannot be left to one discipline, or one frame of reference. Ultimately, while the contributors to this document span a range of disciplines, we share two common goals: supporting contact tracing during a disease outbreak with responsible, safe technologies where it makes sense to deploy them; and ensuring citizens can trust that any technologies being deployed cannot and will not be used in ways that ultimately harm them.
