# Introduction

### Thank you for participating!

Thank you for considering contributing to the SOAP Evaluation framework. This project is stronger due to the wide range of expertise, perspectives, and voices contributed.

_We're delighted to have you on board._

### Why should I read these contributing guidelines?

By following these contributing guidelines, you are helping to respect the time and efforts the researchers, developers and other participants managing and furthering this open source project have committed. In return, we reciprocate that respect by addressing your issue appropriately, assessing proposed changes and assisting you in submitting pull requests.

### What sort of contributions is this project seeking?

We appreciate help with all the following tasks:

* Improving the evaluation framework through worked examples, clarifications and references.

### Are there contributions you're _not_ looking for?

* At this stage, we are not seeking additional products or projects to assess through the SOAP Evaluation.

# What are the expectations of behaviour for this project?

Our expected standards of behaviour are set out in the project [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

# Where should I start?

The best place to start is to read through the White Paper.

### I've never contributed to an open source project before. Where do I start?

Here are a couple of friendly tutorials you can include: http://makeapullrequest.com/ and http://www.firsttimersonly.com/

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:

If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement

### What are the goals and philosophy of this project?

SOAP has been designed with support from researchers across the Australian National University, including computer scientists, cryptographers, legal scholars, epidemiologists, philosophers, data analysts, user researchers, anthropologists, engineers and social scientists. The technical, social, legal and contextual considerations it includes reflect the practicalities - and complexities - of designing and deploying technology solutions. These decisions cannot be left to one discipline, or one frame of reference.

Ultimately, while the contributors to this document span a range of disciplines, we share two common goals: supporting contact tracing during a disease outbreak with responsible, safe technologies where it makes sense to deploy them; and ensuring citizens can trust that any technologies being deployed cannot and will not be used in ways that ultimately harm them.

### What is the process for suggesting a feature?

Ideally, features should be expressed as [user stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story), with _acceptance criteria_ defined if possible.

Features should be requested by creating an Issue on this project.

The project team will assess the feature request, and may request further information from you.

# Review process

### What is the review process on this project?

A member of the project team will review the Issue you have raised and respond either within the Issue, or via return email if you prefer.
